            <!--Text about childhood-->
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>Born in Paris, France, to Georges Bertrand de Beauvoir and Françoise (née) Brasseur, Simone was a very curious child with a thirst for knowledge. She would teach her younger sister, Hélène, as a student. Her father would also introduce her to various forms of literature, and encouraged her to learn and read as much as possible.  However, Simone did not agree with her mother's love for her bourgeois lifestyle. Simone was enrolled in the Institut Adeline Désir to further her Catholic education. During this time, she befriended a girl named Elizabeth Mabille (Zaza). The two were extremely close until Zaza's untimely death in 1929, which Simone believed to be because of the stress of an arranged marriage. This tradition was very popular in the bourgeois lifestyle, and the incident only feuled Simone's strong beliefs against the culture.</p>
